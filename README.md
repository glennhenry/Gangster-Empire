# Goodgame Gangster private server

It barely works. Still in tutorial mission.

## How to play?

(Windows only for now)

1. Install Java 24 (also add them to JAVA_HOME environment variable).
2. Install [Adobe AIR runtime](https://airsdk.harman.com/runtime)
3. Download this repo as ZIP (or clone with Git).
4. Run the server by:
    - Open cmd in the folder where you extract the ZIP, then run `.\gradlew run`.
5. Run the game by going to `static/game` folder then double clicking on `Goodgame Gangster.exe`.

For development, you can instead run the game from `rungame.bat`; this runs the game in debug mode, in which you will need [Adobe AIR SDK](https://airsdk.harman.com/download).
